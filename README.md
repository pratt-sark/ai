  <summary>8 Queens problem & n-Queens problem</summary>
  
  The goal of the n-queens problem is to place n queens on a chessboard such that no queen attacks any other. 
  The problem formulation in terms of the state-space is as follows:
  
  States: Any arrangement of 0-n queens on the board is a state.
  Initial State: No queens on the board.
  Actions: Add a queen to any empty square.
  Transition Model: Returns the board with a queen added to the specified square.
  Goal test: n queens are on the board, none attacked.
  
  Write a program to:
  Solve the problem starting from the initial state and print the solution chessboard.
  Print the number of solutions to the problem.
  Print the number of non-attacking states.
